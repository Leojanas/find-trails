        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Choose the option that you want to search by: Full Address, City, or Zip Code. </p>
        <p>This will take you to the search screen, where you can input the location you have selected as well 
            as other search parameters.  If you want to change your search, you can always press the 
            'Start Over' button to return to the home screen and start again.
        </p>
        <p>On the search screen, the location fields at the top are required.  If you do not have all the info,
            please press 'Start Over' and choose a different search method.  The remaining search fields are all
            optional, use as few or as many as you would like to narrow your search.
        </p>
        <p>The search will take longer if you need it to return more results, but you will also get a more complete results-list
            of hikes that meet the given criteria.
