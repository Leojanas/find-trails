# Find Trails
<a>https://leojanas.github.io/find-trails/</a>
<p>Created by Leo Janas in 2020.</p>
<p>The app uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.</p>
<p>This app accesses The Hiking Project API as well as Google Maps (Geocoding API and Directions Service) to provide a list of hiking trails close to a certain location.
It allows searching by an exact address, a city/state, or by zip code.  It also allows for filtering results with a minimum and maximum length of hike, as well as a 
minimum and maximum elevation gain on the hike. <p>
